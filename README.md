# ESL Locations Learner

### Summary
In-progress application to help teach ESL students about useful locations near them: grocery stores, pharmacys, etc.
Will consist of three section: Listening/pronounciation, typing, and using Google Maps to find nearby locations.

This inspired from my volunteer work at International Rescue Committee in San Jose, where I volunteered teaching basic computer skills and found a dearth of non-flash based ESL education games.
